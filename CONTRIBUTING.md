2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Browser version and extension version
   - Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Enhancements

We welcome enhancement suggestions! Please:

1. Check existing issues/discussions first
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear title describing the enhancement
   - Detailed description of the proposed feature
   - Use cases and benefits
   - Any implementation ideas (optional)

### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `master`
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Comment your code where necessary
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes**:
   - Load the extension in Chrome/Firefox
   - Test all affected functionality
   - Ensure no regressions

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: feature description"
   ```
   
   Use conventional commit messages:
   - `Add:` for new features

5. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use ES6+ JavaScript features
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)

### File Structure

- `background.js` - Core detection logic
- `content.js` - Page-level operations
- `popup.*` - Popup interface
- `options.*` - Settings page
- Keep UI and logic separated

### Adding New Detection Paths

To add new sensitive file paths:

1. Open `background.js`
2. Add to the `SENSITIVE_PATHS` object:
   ```javascript
   newCategory: {
     enabled: true,
     paths: [
       'path/to/file1',
       'path/to/file2'
     ],
     severity: 'critical', // or 'medium' or 'low'
     description: 'Description of category'
   }
   ```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Extension loads without errors
- [ ] Detection works on test sites
- [ ] Popup displays correctly
- [ ] Settings save and load properly
- [ ] Notifications work (if enabled)
- [ ] Sound alerts work (if enabled)
